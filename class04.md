## PostgreSQL Joins

- PostgreSQL join is used to combine columns from one (self-join) or more tables based on the values of the common columns between related tables. The common columns are typically the primary key columns of the first table and foreign key columns of the second table.

PostgreSQL supports inner join, left join, right join, full outer join, cross join, natural join, and a special kind of join called self-join.

## one-to-one

- In systems analysis, a one-to-one relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities (see also entity–relationship model) A and B in which one element of A may only be linked to one element of B, and vice versa.

## one-to-many

- In systems analysis, a one-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities (see also entity–relationship model) A and B in which an element of A may be linked to many elements of B, but a member of B is linked to only one element of A.

## many-to-many

- In systems analysis, a many-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities[1] A and B in which A may contain a parent instance for which there are many children in B and vice versa.
